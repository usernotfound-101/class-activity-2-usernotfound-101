<br><br><h>Here are a list of 5 errors I found in code:</h>
1. L1 no colon ":" after function definition
2. L6 its not "\*\*\*" only '\*' for multiplication, and '\*\*' for exponentiation
3. L3 and L4 it shouldn't be the comparison operator '==' but the assignment operator '='
4. L10 function definition missing colon
5. L12 for loop missing colon
6. L13 semicolon missing and function names is wrong, not is_narcissistic but is_narc;
7. Last line should be print_naris_number
8. int print_narcis_number parameters should be seperated by comma
9. L13 if statement missing colon
