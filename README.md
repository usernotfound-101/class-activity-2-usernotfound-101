Here are a list of 5 errors I found in code:
1. L1 no colon ":" after function definition
2. L6 its not '***' only '*' for multiplication, and '**'
3. L3 and L4 and L8 it shouldn't be the comparison operator '==' but the assignment operator '='
4. L10 function definition missing colon
5. L12 for loop missing colon
6. L13 semicolon missing and function names is wrong, not is_narcissistic but is_narc;
